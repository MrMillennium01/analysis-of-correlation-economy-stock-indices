# analysis-of-correlation-economy-stock-indices

This personal project explores how stock market indices relate to a country’s economic performance. The repository contains a notebook with the full walkthrough, including assumptions, reasoning, and intermediate results.

## Purpose
The project focuses on building practical skills in economic data analysis while developing a better intuition for how macroeconomic indicators and equity markets move together. It’s also a learning framework for thinking about long-term investing with more context than simply “buy an index because someone said so.”

## What you’ll find
- A Jupyter notebook documenting the analysis step by step  
- Data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and correlation-focused comparisons  
- Notes on interpretation, limitations, and ideas to extend the work  

## Getting Started
To get started with this project:

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Make sure you have Python 3 installed, along with Jupyter Notebook and the required packages (e.g., pandas, matplotlib, yfinance, pandas_datareader).
3. Open any of the notebooks (e.g., Chapter1_wealth_distribution.ipynb) in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.
4. Run the cells to reproduce the analysis and visualizations.

### Recommended Python packages
- pandas
- matplotlib
- yfinance
- pandas_datareader

You can install them using:
```
pip install pandas matplotlib yfinance pandas_datareader
```

## Project status
This is an ongoing, evolving project. New analyses, datasets, and refinements will be added over time—feel free to pull the latest version periodically.
