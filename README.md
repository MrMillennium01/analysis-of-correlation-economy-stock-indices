# analysis-of-correlation-economy-stock-indices

This personal project explores how stock market indices relate to a country’s economic performance. The repository contains a notebook with the full walkthrough, including assumptions, reasoning, and intermediate results.

## Purpose
The project focuses on building practical skills in economic data analysis while developing a better intuition for how macroeconomic indicators and equity markets move together. It’s also a learning framework for thinking about long-term investing with more context than simply “buy an index because someone said so.”

## What you’ll find
- A Jupyter notebook documenting the analysis step by step  
- Data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and correlation-focused comparisons  
- Notes on interpretation, limitations, and ideas to extend the work  

## Project status
This is an ongoing, evolving project. New analyses, datasets, and refinements will be added over time—feel free to pull the latest version periodically.

## Note
This repository is for learning and research. It is not financial advice, and results may change depending on time periods, data sources, and methodology.
